# Does Sharks attack more when they are horny?

## Could sharks attack more when they are in their mating season?
Its an interesting question 

For this hypothesis we would have to go throw some exploration into the data, we have to go throw investigate the dates, months of mating f each species and analysed it with the data frame that we have about sharks attacks around the world and start making some comparizon and answer quiestions.

## Information about mating season.
I had to go throw some deep investigation about their mating season, depending of each type of species. 
I choose the most common species by the attacks they have made in the data frame that we have.


## Conclution.
